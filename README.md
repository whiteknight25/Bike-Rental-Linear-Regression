## General Information
- A bike sharing company has experienced considerable dips in their revenues due to Covid.The company aims to revive in post pandemic market situation.The company management would  like to understand the key variables that influence their bike rentals in positive / negative way. There from they will adapt necessary actions to increase their revenues.

- Dataset used day.csv which has 730 records spanned accross the years v2018 and 2019.


## Conclusions
- Firstly we conclude that the number of records are not suffient to generate an efficient model.
- Based on the available data we conclude the a muli linearity exists between the target variable 'cnt' and some of the predictor variables.
- R-Square value on test data came out as 75 which is quiote good and close to the train data r square value. So we conclude that our designed model has achieved a significant efficacy.
